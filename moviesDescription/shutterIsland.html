            <strong> SHUTTER ISlAND </strong> is a classic Thriller. It's a story of a US Marshall named <b> Teddy </b>who was
            sent to investigate in
            mental sanatorium based in Shutter Island in order to find the murderer of his wife called Andrew Laeddis.

            At this point you might think that this is a basic innvestigation story, but as long as the movie goes on
            you'll find out that this hole investigation was a mental experience to help the main character to overcome
            the death of his wife.

            What i love about this movie is the twist of the story. So when you watch the movie for the first time, you
            would never guess the end.
