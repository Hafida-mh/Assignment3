        <p>
            Me and my sister did a sort of <b> campaign in our neighborhood to save the whales </b>. So we wrote a bunch of signs... 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img 
          src="../images/saveWhales-01.jpg"
          alt="save the whales"
        >
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            But as you can guess nobody takes us seriously. As a matter of fact, everybody who saw our RIDICULOUS CAMPAIGN thought probably <b> whatâ€™s wrong with those girls ? </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            After this BIG FAIL <i class='bx bx-sad'> </i>  we completely forgot about whales.. 
            <a href="./secondStory.html"> until the day i  graduated from university </a>.
