        <p>
            After this rejection, I started looking for a job but it wasnâ€™t easier either
            because every company was searching for experienced people. So during this period
            of time, i was obsessed with some movies like :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="../moviesDescription/shutterIsland.html"> Shutter Island ; </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="../moviesDescription/sevenPounds.html"> Seven Pounds ; </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="../moviesDescription/cityOfAngels.html"> City of Angels </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also spent a lot of my free time sewing and coding.
            After that I found a job so eventually I started to watch more joyful movies and series <i class='bx bx-smile'></i>.
